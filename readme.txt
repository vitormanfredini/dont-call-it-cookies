== A Wordpress Plugin that replaces the term "Cookies" for "Data Collectors" in cookie consent bars/popups. ==

It's made to be simple, lightweight and easy for anyone with a wordpress powered website to use.

The plugin currently supports 3 of the most popular cookie consent plugins in the Wordpress Plugin Directory:
* [CookieYes | GDPR Cookie Consent & Compliance Notice (CCPA Ready)](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cookie-law-info/)
* [GDPR Cookie Compliance (CCPA ready)](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gdpr-cookie-compliance/)
* [Complianz | GDPR/CCPA Cookie Consent](https://wordpress.org/plugins/complianz-gdpr/)

== Installation ==

Copy the `dont-call-it-cookies` folder inside your `plugins` folder and activate it.

If you already have one of the supported plugins installed, then that's it.

If you dont't, then just install one of them before activating our plugin.
