Replaces the term "Cookies" for "Data Collectors" in the most popular Cookie Consent Plugins.

== Description ==

Misleading terminology tricks kids into giving away their private information online without consent.

This plugin does one simple thing: it replaces the term "Cookies" for "Data Collectors" in the most popular Cookie Consent Plugins in the Wordpress Plugin Directory.

It's made to be simple and easy for anyone with a wordpress powered website to use.

The plugin currently supports 3 of the most popular cookie consent plugins in the Wordpress Plugin Directory:
* [CookieYes | GDPR Cookie Consent & Compliance Notice (CCPA Ready)](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cookie-law-info/)
* [GDPR Cookie Compliance (CCPA ready)](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gdpr-cookie-compliance/)
* [Complianz | GDPR/CCPA Cookie Consent](https://wordpress.org/plugins/complianz-gdpr/)

== Installation ==

Install it through the Wordpress admin area and activate it.

Manual installation (if you can't install it through the admin area): Copy the `dont-call-it-cookies` folder inside your `plugins` folder and activate it.

If you already have one of the supported cookie consent plugins installed, then that's it.

If you don't, then just install one of them before activating our plugin.
